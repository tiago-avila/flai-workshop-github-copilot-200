# 🎮 Assignment: Hangman Game in Python

## 🎯 Objective

Build a classic Hangman game using Python. Practice string manipulation, loops, conditionals, and random selection while creating an interactive word-guessing game.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1: Set Up the Game

#### Description
Create a Python script that sets up the basic structure for the Hangman game, including a list of possible words and variables to track the game state.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Define a list of at least 5 possible words
- Randomly select a word for the player to guess
- Initialize variables to track guessed letters and remaining attempts

### 🛠️ Task 2: Implement Game Logic

#### Description
Write the main game loop that allows the player to guess letters, updates the display, and checks for win/lose conditions.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Prompt the player to guess one letter at a time
- Show the current progress (e.g., _ a _ _ m a n)
- Track and display incorrect guesses remaining
- End the game with a win message if the word is guessed
- End the game with a lose message if attempts run out
